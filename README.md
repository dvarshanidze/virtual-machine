# Virtual Machine in C

Welcome to the **Virtual Machine in C** repository! This project features a simple and extensible virtual machine (VM) implemented in C. The VM is designed for educational purposes and experimentation, providing a platform to run bytecode instructions and manage virtual execution environments.

## Features

- **Bytecode Execution**: Executes a set of bytecode instructions within the VM.
- **Stack-Based Architecture**: Uses a stack to manage function calls and execution state.
- **Memory Management**: Basic memory management with support for dynamic allocation.
- **Simple Instruction Set**: Includes a minimal set of instructions for operations like arithmetic, logic, and control flow.
